            For over two decades, "NGO" has partnered with communities 
            across Uganda to improve access to essential health services, strengthen
            food security, and expand inclusive education opportunities. Our work places children
            and young people—especially those with disabilities—at the center, supporting their rights,
            dignity, and ability to build healthier, more secure, and hopeful futures.
